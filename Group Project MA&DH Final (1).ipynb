Pakistan Average Mean Surface Air Temperature Annual Trends with Significance of Trend per Decade; 1951-2023; Pakistan  \n    Source: World Bank, Climate Change Knowledge Portal, Pakistan, Current Climate, Trends & Variability (ERA5)\n    https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/country/pakistan/trends-variability-historical\n\nThis small dataset gives the average year-round surface temperature across Pakistan in degrees Celsius for each year from 1950-2023. It is similar to the US temperature dataset that was used in the original study, and serves the same purpose of analyzing the correlation between warming temperatures and the other variables.\n\n> 2. The International Disaster Database EM-DAT, CRED / UCLouvain, Brussels, Belgium – www.emdat.be\n\nThis large dataset covers a wide variety of natural and technological disasters around the world since 1900, and data about each of them. In this project, we can ignore most of these variables and just count how many natural disasters have occurred in Pakistan each year in order to analyze the trends and correlation. Filtering this data will lead to a similar dataset to the US disaster data used in the original study.\n\n> 3. Consumption-based CO2 emissions by country in millions of tonnes from 1800-2022.\n    Source: Free data called the GM CO2 Long Series, based on Global Carbon Project, CDAIC and other sources, and obtained via gapminder.org, CC-BY license.\n    Sourced from the menus at https://www.gapminder.org/data/, and more info at http://gapm.io/dco2_consumption_historic\n\nThis large dataset is a similar but more complete and updated version of the CO2 data from the original study, counting the total estimated CO2 emissions per country from fossil fuel use and cement production, in millions of tons for each year from 1800-2022. Many of the relevant graphs can be obtained from this dataset alone, as this data allows for plotting and comparing the emissions of every country around the world.\n\n> 4. GDP per capita yearly growth by country from 1801-2019.\n    Source: Free data from World Bank via gapminder.org, CC-BY license. Downloaded from the menus at https://www.gapminder.org/data/, and the original source data can be found at https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.ZG\n\nThis dataset notes the estimated percentage change in each country's real GDP per capita from year to year for every year from 1801-2019, showing how quickly a country's economy was growing or shrinking at each point in time. This data is an updated version of the dataset used in the original study, and we will use it for some of the plots comparing several variables about Pakistan to the rest of the world.\n\n> 5. Energy use (kg of oil equivalent per capita) by country from 1960-2024.\n    Source: World Bank, https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.USE.PCAP.KG.OE\n\nThis dataset measures the amount of primary energy consumption per person, in kilograms of oil equivalent (kgoe), in each country in a given year.

Using the data properly in conjuction with relevant Python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn can turn raw numbers into valuable educational tools, allowing one to visually comprehend the world's climatic and economic variability and how these things affect each other.\n\nWhile the data used has been reported by official agencies, we must acknowledge that data is often incomplete. There may be additional emissions and disasters not reported in the data, especially for years further in the past. When comparing multiple datasets, we must restrict the comparison to a timespan where all of the datasets contain reliable data, limiting the amount of data that can be compared. In the context of Pakistan, it is also imperative to note that while research and data is gathered, it is not nearly prioritized enough to report consumption accurately due to lack of resources and oversight that often end up ignoring information that may be crucial to reporting the data.","metadata":{}},{"id":"f539a4bf-295c-4dbf-bd8a-463cf02c7612","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Import","metadata":{}},{"id":"0e8d0a9f-2755-4837-ba98-9746abf0049e","cell_type":"markdown","source":"First, we will import the relevant packages for this project:","metadata":{}},{"id":"6707b882-fbd8-4be0-afc2-6f3d93a27a2e","cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport os\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport re","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":2},{"id":"affd73c3-df19-486b-b4e1-533fa706967d","cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, we can use pandas to import the relevant data from the accompanying files.

However, this on its own does not prove that one causes the other, they could both be influenced by some other factor such as coexisting but unrelated trends over time. Indeed, a warming climate in Pakistan is presumably influenced by all of the world's emissions, but our analysis only compared against emissions in Pakistan. While the data is clear both that the climate of Pakistan is warming and that emissions are going up, it does not prove that Pakistan's emissions are the only factor involved.","metadata":{}},{"id":"4166b4ee-ea44-4159-b5b5-c363465da852","cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can also standardize the scale of both datasets to have 0 mean and 1 standard deviation by using the numpy mean and std functions:","metadata":{}},{"id":"558942d9-71f4-41ed-8d9f-c77ffbaf26f8","cell_type":"code","source":"scale_data=correl_data\nscale_data[\"Temperature\"]=((scale_data[\"Temperature\"])-np.mean(scale_data[\"Temperature\"]))/np.std(scale_data[\"Temperature\"])\nscale_data[\"Emissions\"]=((scale_data[\"Emissions\"])-np.mean(scale_data[\"Emissions\"]))/np.std(scale_data[\"Emissions\"])","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"id":"b7208056-29a6-410a-8f93-34bd44f75310","cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, we can plot a scatter plot where both axes are standardized to this specific scale.
